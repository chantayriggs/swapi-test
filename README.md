# Practice Coding Test

The objective of this task is to develop a code that retrieves data from the [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/) (Star Wars API). The requirements are as follows:
1. Retrieve and display a list of characters using the "/people" endpoint.
2. Implement pagination to display characters from each individual page.
3. Include two buttons to navigate between pages: a previous button and a next button.
4. Disable the buttons when there is no additional data available through pagination.


## Requirements
1. It is preferable to use React and either JavaScript or TypeScript.
2. You are free to choose any library for implementation or use plain JavaScript.
3. The focus of this task is on the code that interacts with the API; CSS styling is not necessary.

## Method
Can either use [CodeSandbox](http://codesandbox.io/) and develop your solution there, or you can fork this repo and open a PR to submit your solution.
